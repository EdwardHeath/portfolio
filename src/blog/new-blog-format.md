title: "New Blog Format"

I've implemented a new blog format! Using the power of Gatsby plugins, I've been able to 
create a functioning blog with the ability for me to easily add entries. I'm still exploring
the possibilities, but I feel this is the next step in developing my personal website. 

Using the [Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/), I can now add markdown files
to my project and they will automatically be added to my blog page. Not only that, but they will
create their own blog page, complete with their own slugs! This is a very powerful concept that
I will soon be adapting to my project page to automate adding those to my site once they are
complete.
